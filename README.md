## Introduction

Application developed during Rocketseat's NLW, with the aim of making the organization of participants in a fictitious event practical (it can be adapted to a real one), where the user can request their credential, obtain it on the screen of the mobile device and present it on the day of the event to release their entry with the unique QR Code generated for each participant.

---
## Technologies

-  [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/) for API consumption;
-  [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/docs.html/) as the database;
-  [React Native](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/) with the [Expo](https://expo.io/);
-  [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) for communication with the API;
-  [NativeWind](https://www.nativewind.dev/) to style the components;
-  [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) as the ORM for the database;
-  [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for data typing;
-  [Zod](https://zod.dev/) to validate the data;
-  [Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/) for global state management.

  - Also, you **need** a package manager, the one I used was **[NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)**;
  - Finally, you must have **[Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go)** installed on your device if you want to view the application directly from it.
